// The semantic-equivalence optimization layer.
//
// This module is the HOME for rewrites that change what a program COSTS
// without changing what it MEANS -- the compiler-side of "the fastest way is
// the only way". Rules of admission, each load-bearing:
//
//   1. COST ONLY, NEVER CONTRACT. A pass may derive an early exit, collapse
//      a loop, or fold a decided branch; it may never add or remove an
//      abort, a licence, or an observable value. (The `while` guard's
//      budget abort is a CONTRACT and therefore a surface spelling, not an
//      optimization -- see recognizeFreezeIdiom below for the boundary.)
//   2. TWIN-SAFE. Both back ends and the interpreter consume the rewritten
//      tree (passes run in Lowering, or pre-lowering where the equivalence
//      is only decidable there), so the differential gates hold by
//      construction; a pass that could not keep them byte-identical does
//      not belong here.
//   3. ESCAPABLE. Every pass carries a per-call environment gate
//      (BLADE_FUSION, BLADE_FREEZE_IDIOM, ...) so any rewrite can be A/B'd
//      against its absence. Gates are functions, never cached module lets
//      -- tests pin and restore them mid-process.
//   4. DECIDABLE AT ITS OWN SEAM. Most passes are IR->IR, but a recognition
//      whose evidence dissolves by IR time (the recursive-array freeze
//      idiom, whose declarative shape only exists on RecArrayDef) runs at
//      the last seam where it is exact. The layer is defined by the charter
//      above, not by a pipeline position.
//
// Implementations that PREDATE the layer live in IRMono for dependency
// reasons -- foldConstIntMatch is shared with the arity specializer (which
// needs it DURING specialization for recursion termination), and the fusion
// pass grew up beside the binop rewrite it runs after. `optimizeModule` is
// the single pipeline entry over them; new passes land in this file.

// --- Freeze-idiom recognition (plan-match-statements.md section 5, R7/B) ---
//
// The hand-written convergence idiom on a recursive array's inductive arm:
//
//   | prefix :: n -> prefix :: (if G then STEP else prefix(n - 1))
//
// declares a fixed point: once G is false the slice repeats. When G's only
// per-iteration inputs are reads of prefix(n - 1), falseness is ABSORBING --
// the frozen slice reproduces exactly the inputs the guard just judged
// false, so it stays false by induction -- and the remaining iterations are
// provably copies. Rewriting the definition to the guarded form WITHOUT the
// abort (`Guard = Some G, Slice = STEP`, best-effort) then derives the early
// exit and the freeze epilogue from machinery that already exists, and the
// emitted values are byte-identical to running the budget out: the epilogue
// writes the same repeated slice the else-arm would have written, and every
// skipped guard evaluation is a repeat of one that already completed (G is
// pure surface arithmetic; its inputs no longer change).
//
// This is cost-only by construction, which is the R7 boundary: the `while`
// spelling OPTS INTO the must-converge contract (BL8010 when the budget
// runs out); the recognized idiom keeps if/else's contract -- run to
// budget, freeze if done early, never abort. Same analysis, same break,
// different contract, chosen by spelling.
//
// Soundness demands three shape checks, all CONSERVATIVE (any unrecognized
// node declines recognition rather than guessing):
//   - the else-arm is EXACTLY `prefix(n - 1)` (the whole previous slice --
//     an else that repairs, decays, or reads deeper lags is a live arm, not
//     a freeze);
//   - the guard's prefix reads are all at lag 1, and it references neither
//     the step ordinal outside those reads (a guard varying with `n`
//     independently of the trajectory is NOT absorbing: `n < k` flips on
//     its own) nor the bare prefix family;
//   - every call the guard makes is to a PURE scalar intrinsic (the caller
//     decides which names qualify -- see `calleeAdmissible` below). The
//     skipped guard evaluations are only repeats if evaluating the guard
//     changes nothing: a guard that calls a helper with a `mut` parameter
//     mutates its own input, so its first false answer is not absorbing
//     (plan-fortran-killer-2.md appendix A: `if tick(counter) then ...`
//     froze the trajectory at 1 and dropped six of seven `tick` calls), and
//     a helper that prints or aborts has effects the freeze would drop even
//     when its value would repeat. A user-declared function -- pure or not
//     -- therefore declines today: this seam sees names, not resolved
//     bodies, and an invariant NAME does not make a call repeatable. The
//     P0 follow-up (plan-fortran-killer-2.md section 3) is to keep the
//     candidate and discharge purity against the typed callee, which would
//     re-admit provably pure helpers.
